# Oqypqal
This our project for the Python course "Oqypqal" bookstore

In this project we have made a realization of bookstore.
In this project we have used the Django as main backend framework and React.js as frontend framework.
The data about books is stored, created and controlled by Django.
The whole project is built on the concept of React getting all the data from certain url by `axios API` and rendering 
it and showing on the screen. And Django, exactly `djangorestframework` as the backend service sends the data as a
`.json` file from its database to that url.
